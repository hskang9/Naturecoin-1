In addition, it helps to prevent waste inefficiency, fraud, and unethical practices.

## 2. Recycling

Current recycling programs often give little or no incentive for people to participate. The responsibility for running these programs often falls on individual cities, and it can be difficult to track their impact. A recycling program on the blockchain would encourage participation by giving a financial reward in the form of cryptographic token in exchange for depositing recyclables(plastic containers, cans, or bottles). It would also make it easy to transparently track the amounts the materials recycled costs and profits and evaluate the impact of each participant in the program.
